# Zoom Simplified.

###### Zoom Webpages In and Out, simplified. From 100% to 130%.

Click to zoom, click to reset zoom. A pretty simple extension using the regular zoom api. Mostly for aesthetic (rather than the default button that takes up spacing equivilant to 3 buttons on the nav bar).

v0.1

- Clicking the extension will toggle zoom between 100% and 130% based on the browsers zoom factor.
- Support added for future 'custom' zoom factor. (Option page, or context option)
